# Reproducing results

## Tools

We have compared pyTCR to the following TCR-Seq post-processing tools:

* VDJtools, https://vdjtools-doc.readthedocs.io/en/master/
* immunarch, https://immunarch.com/

## Data

We downloaded the COVID19-BWNW dataset, which was part of the ImmuneRACE Study, from ImmuneCODEâ„¢ database (https://immunerace.adaptivebiotech.com/data). 

[data](https://github.com/Mangul-Lab-USC/pyTCR_publication/tree/main/data/samples) includes the data that created all figures in the manuscript.

## Notebooks and Figures

[notebooks](https://github.com/Mangul-Lab-USC/pyTCR_publication/tree/main/notebooks) includes the Jupyter notebooks for all figures in the manuscript. 

[figures](https://github.com/Mangul-Lab-USC/pyTCR_publication/tree/main/figures) includes all of the image files for the plots generated by notebooks.
